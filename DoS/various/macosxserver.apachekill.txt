Subject: MacOS X system panic with CGI

Hello all,

when doing performance tests with different web servers,
I found, that MacOS X Server running apache crashed under
medium load, when I was calling CGI-scripts.

It displays "system panic" and a stack trace with ipc_task_init.

The problem appears when 32 or more processes are doing
GET-requests to a cgi script in a loop.

I could reproduce this on two different G3-Macs with
100%. It doesn't matter, if the processes run local or
remote (I tried it via LAN with 10 MBit). Crashes appear after
30 seconds to a couple of minutes.

I suppose this is a bug in the Mach kernel and *not*
limited to CGI scripts. I could find no other ways to
trigger it yet. So disabling CGI scripts might help for
some time.

You can check your machine, using the apache benchmark
(ab, include on the MacOS X server) with the script at the end.
Any other program to do HTTP requests in a loop should do.

Apple has been informed. They could reproduce the bug
at least once.

We have published the issue under:
http://www.heise.de/ct/english/99/13/186/



bye, ju

Just a reminder that you can check out the kernel source (and just
about everything else in MOSXS) for yourself by going to
http://publicsource.apple.com
